# Getting ready for fonts

Notice that the yaml at the beginning of this file includes a latex_engine which will be used 
when creating a pdf document.

It also includes a mainfont setting called _DejaVu Sans_.  This is not the only font that will 
work to produce the spark graphs. However, it is a free font available through the
`extrafont` package.  If you have not installed extrafont you should do so using the normal
package installation procedures. You should then make sure that the desired font is installed.

The code below will not run automatically when you knit, instead you should run it in the
console. 

```
install.packages(c("extrafont"))
font_install("DejaVu Sans")
```

If there are any difficulties please read the extrafont documentation.

 
```{r, message=FALSE}

library(knitr)
library(skimr)
